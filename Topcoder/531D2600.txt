Suppose that we are choose the possibility of sets from i song 
list using j different kind of songs.

1-We can push the song to the list that never pushed to the list
2-We can push the song that pushed before

which gives us this formula : 
f(i,j)=f(i-1,j-1)+f(i-1,j)*(j-M)

So our answer is f(P,N)*N!
