We use dp to solve this problem.

dp[a][b][c]

a - current disk
b - length used for current disk
c - current song

For first, loop c+1 to N for stack a new song to current disk.
We have two cases for this. First, (suppose d is for new one) 
push d'th song into a'th disk. Second, push d'th song into a+1'th disk.

dp[a][b+len[d]][d] depends on dp[a][b][c]+1
or
dp[a+1][len[d]][d] depends on dp[a][b][c]+1
