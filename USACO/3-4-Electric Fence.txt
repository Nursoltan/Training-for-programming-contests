Firstly, we need to know pick's theorom.
That is for calculate some regular polygon's area.
A=I+B/2-1;

A stands for area of the polygon
I is number of lattice points inside the polygon
B is number of lattice points polygon's boundary.

For this problem we need to calculate I.

That triangle's area is M*P/2. (we have given N,M,P)
Suppose we have divided into two right angled triangles.
Left side's area is N*M/2, the other one's (P-N)*M/2
Our triangle's area is sum of these two triangles.
N*M/2+(P-N)*M/2=P*M/2

So now, we need to know B. How to calculate B?

Suppose we have line segment that (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
Number of integer points of this segment is 
gcd(|x1-x2|,|y1-y2|)+1.

We have three line segments and 3 points are duplicated, which is 
sum of B's of these 3 lines and substract 3.
